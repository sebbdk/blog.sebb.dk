##GG Flash

![alt text](./img/flash_logo.jpg)

I have been working a lot less with flash recently.
Not because i do not like flash anymore, but my only real usecase is as a fallback for video streaming on older browsers.

In fact the only real flash project i have been working on for a long time 
Have been the game Moonnmachine which is a collaboration i have been working on for 6 months or so.

I have now made a concious descision not to use flash again if i can avoid it.

To no'ones surprise, Flash has been steadily decaying the last few years, desptite actually having become much better than it was in the past.

The arrival of stage3d a few years back, improvements to Flash Develop, flash CC, Air and the list goes on.
The problems is that today' they are getting outmatched in most fields. 

Unity3D is 100% a better game development enviroment and has better performance, 
webgl is supported on most mobile devices nowadays making webgl a better multiplatform sollution for graphical webapplications, rivaling the same performance that native mobile air applications has on some systems.

To put it short, there are better tools to get the job done, and i am going to use those instead.

Flash had a good run, and still have a oppotunity to rise but they need to ramp up and and tool up instead of ignorering what their competitors are doing today.

If anything, Unity3D has proven that providing the tools and libraries developers needs from day one massively helps developers make things, add on top of this the Unity asset store to give library developers more incent to help the comunity and you have something that works great.



*I wanne mention the things i really like about flash also tho.*

* The flash CC series is a awesome animation tool hands down, and AS3 it the best variation of ecmascript i have worked with to date, it is basically everything i think javascript should have been.

* Flash has one of thé best communities to get help and find resources in. Adobe even apointed developer evangelists to write tutorials and help the community grow, there are plrenty of meetups and groups online to participate in. 

* The documentation for AS3 is AWESOME, and has always been so.

* Did i mention AS3 is Ecmascript based? this basically means you can write code in a bajillion different ways!

* Flash CC and Flash developer works great together to bridge the gap between code and 2D vector graphics when you need it.

* I had a TON of fun learning and experiemnting with AS3, which is easy to learn.

* The sheer amount of great libraries out there makes it easy not to have to start from scratch, and all the important ones have aged very well.

And those things are just the things off the top of my head.

*In summary, i think flash is great, i loved working with it but recently the headache of doing the same things other tools can do better and faster is simply not woth the effort to do in flash.*

It has been a good run, thank you Flash!
